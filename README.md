# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
I created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. This website will ask for a country, a zip code, and some text to generate a diary entry with the weather of the current date. The generated diary entry will be post to the server and save as the most recent entry.
